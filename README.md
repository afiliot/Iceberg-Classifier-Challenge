# Iceberg_classifier_Kaggle

In this repo you'll find the project I made on the "Statoil C-CORE Classifier Challenge" Kaggle competition as part of my second year training in the ENSAE ParisTech (École Nationale de la Statistique et de l'Administration Économique, branch school of École Polytechnique for statistics, data science and machine learning). 

This competition aims at developing a model of classification between icebergs and ships based on satellite images. The dataset contains 1604 observations (i.e 1604 couples of 2 images) and was submitted by Statoil (international oil company) in partnership with C-CORE (R&D consultant proposing innovative solutions linked with the energy field's issues).

This project is first dedicated to images processing thanks to the Python package scikit image and implementation of machine learning techniques using scikit learn. 

Then you'll find my first Convutional Neural Network (CNN) carried out with Keras and TensorFlow.

Finally there's a brief comparison of the two models and prolongations on how is it possible to use those models in an industrial context.
